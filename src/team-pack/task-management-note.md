# Task Management (Team Mode Active)

Team Mode is enabled. Use the **Task\*** tools for task management instead of TodoWrite:

| Use This   | Not This               |
| ---------- | ---------------------- |
| TaskCreate | TodoWrite (deprecated) |
| TaskUpdate | TodoWrite (deprecated) |
| TaskList   | TodoWrite (deprecated) |
| TaskGet    | TodoWrite (deprecated) |

The TodoWrite tool may appear in your tool list but is blocked. Always use the Task\* tools for:

- Creating tasks: `TaskCreate`
- Tracking progress: `TaskUpdate` with comments
- Viewing tasks: `TaskList` and `TaskGet`
- Marking complete: `TaskUpdate` with status: "resolved"

The Task\* tools enable multi-agent collaboration with shared task storage.
